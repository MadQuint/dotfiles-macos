# Dotfiles for MacOS Development Environments

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This is where I store and manage all the configuration files for my MacOS software and web development setup. 

## What are Dotfiles? 

Dotfiles are basically various application settings and preferences that can be saved as plain text files (usually with a dot at the beginning of the filename, hence "dotfiles"). By storing these in a repository, you can easily replicate your customized environment when you set up a new machine. No need to spend hours tweaking everything manually!

## The purpose of this repo

- Optimize your development workflow and boost productivity
- Save tons of time when setting up a new Mac for coding
- Automate the configuration of your favorite tools and apps
- Keep your settings in sync across multiple machines
- Open source your configs without exposing sensitive data

## Getting Started 

WIP

## What's Inside? 

Here's a overview of what will be included:

- VSCode settings and snippets
- Alacrity preferences
- Raycast preferences and custom components
- Window manager preferences

I'm constantly tweaking and adding to these, so be sure to check back often!
