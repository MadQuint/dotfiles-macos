# Dotfiles for MacOS Development Environments

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This is where I store and manage all the configuration files for my MacOS software and web development setup.

## What are Dotfiles?

Dotfiles are basically various application settings and preferences that can be saved as plain text files (usually with a dot at the beginning of the filename, hence "dotfiles"). By storing these in a repository, you can easily replicate your customized environment when you set up a new machine. No need to spend hours tweaking everything manually!

## The purpose of this repo

- Optimize your development workflow and boost productivity
- Save tons of time when setting up a new Mac for coding
- Automate the configuration of your favorite tools and apps
- Keep your settings in sync across multiple machines
- Open source your configs without exposing sensitive data

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and run the `install.sh` script to set up your development environment. This script will install all the necessary tools and applications, as well as symlink the dotfiles to their respective locations.

```bash
git clone
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

## What's Inside?

- Shell configuration (Zsh)
- Zsh plugins and themes
- Git configuration and aliases
- VSCode settings
- Alacritty preferences
- Window manager preferences
- Custom function to query Perplexity AI from terminal
- Homebrew bundle with my most-used packages and casks
- Backup and restore Application settings with Mackup
- Terminal Preferences
- Dock Preferences
- Mission Control Preference (don't rearrange spaces)
- Finder Show Path Bar
- Trackpad (Three Finger Drag and Tap to Click)
- FNM for node version management

I'm constantly tweaking and adding to these, so be sure to check back often!
